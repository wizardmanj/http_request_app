print_1337.js : Transforms the html string into 13375p34k (aka leetspeak, like how 'h4x0rs' talked in the 90s) - this is very similar to your password obfuscator from w1d1, with a few additional letters to substitute, and a few strings:
a : '4', e : '3', l : '1', o : '0', s : '5', t : '7', 'ck' : 'x', 'er' : '0r', 'you' : 'j00'
The last three ('ck' : 'x', 'er' : '0r', 'you' : 'j00') may be tough, depending on how you implement your solution. ('er' : '0r' is almost guaranteed to be an issue, can you spot why?) Consider these stretch-on-stretch 
and don't get behind if they give you trouble. You can always return to this later.
